# dog-breed-classifier
The program takes an image as an input and determines if it is a human, dog, or neither and what type of dog breed it looks like. It uses transfer learning on the InceptionV3 image recognition model. The outputs of this model are fed in as features into several densely connnected layers with a softmax activation in the final layer to generate probabilities of the input image being each of 133 dog breeds. The breed with hte highest probability is returned. This program achieves greated than 80% accuraccy in choosign a dog breed. (randomly guessing would be about 0.75% accurate. This program also uses OpenCV's implementation of Harr feature-based cascade classifiers to detect if the image is a human face. The total data set used included 8351 images of dogs: 6680 for training, 835 for validation, and 836 for testing. This data set is not included in this repository as it is too large. The data manipulating, trainging, and testing are all performed in the jupyter notebook file "dog_app.ipynb". The classifier program can be run with the python file "dog_breed.py" which uses the best performing weights saved after training. It uses any images saved in the "test" folder as inputs. There is currently only one image in there. When run the program will display the image and output whether it is a human, dog or neither and what dog breed it looks like.
